# Hi, I'm Benedikt 👋

Venture Fellow at Spira Labs and Picus Capital, with an MSc in Applied Computational Science and Engineering from Imperial College London. I like building ML systems for real world and scientific problems.

- 🔬 Interests: ML & AI, representation learning, optimization, scientific machine learning
- 💻 Mainly using: Python, C++, PyTorch, CUDA, MPI, Docker, Git
- 🌍 Based in Munich, previously in London and Boston
- 🌐 Languages: German, English

## Featured projects

- 🧠 **Early pancreatic cancer detection on CT** [`Harvard Thesis`](https://github.com/benedikt-samwer/harvard_masterthesis)    
  3D CNN and radiomics models for pre diagnostic CT, focused on calibration, uncertainty, and clinical usability. 

- 🌍 **Full waveform inversion for geophysics** [`Imperial`](https://github.com/benedikt-samwer/imperial_genetic_algorithm_group_project)  
  Numerical optimization and simulation for seismic imaging, gradient based methods and HPC oriented implementation. 

- ⚙️ **Imperial deep learning experiments** [`Imperial`](https://github.com/benedikt-samwer/imperial_deep_learning_1)   
  Collection of coursework and experimental projects, with an emphasis on training stability, evaluation, and reproducibility. 

## Currently

- 🚀 Exploring venture ideas in healthcare and AI at Spira Labs and Picus Capital as a Venture Fellow.
- 🧪 Working on ML for early cancer detection and medical imaging, drawing on my DFCI and Harvard Medical School internship.
- 🧩 Playing with LLM agents, retrieval pipelines, and evaluation setups for real world use cases.
